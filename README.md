# etch-a-sketch



Etch a sketch game I developed as part of the odin project. the design was implemented by me and the functionality of the assignment included

1) create a grid using javascript
2) players should have the option to change the grid size to any number but a maximum of 100
3) theres a pop up when user clicks create grid that allows them to input the grid number and the grid is then generated for them
4) option to add rainbow colors
5) option to erase the grid attribute
6) option to reset the grid right away.


I really enjoyed creeating this project because it chanllenged my problem solving sklills and the ability to research how to implement the logic.
